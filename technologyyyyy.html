Technology is an evergreen field which is always in progress
Kids Definition of technology
1: the use of science in solving problems (as in industry or engineering)
2: a method of or machine for doing something that is created by technology

It might seem a straightforward question, but technology is about more than gadgets and gizmos. Andy Lane explains what it means to different people.

The role and impact of technology in both our personal and working lives is ever growing. Understanding how people shape technology and how technology shapes people's interactions with each other and the natural world is important not only for those who research, develop and implement new technologies but also for all those people and organisations that have to use those technologies in their working and personal lives.

Technology is not a neutral word. Different people will give it different meaning depending on their viewpoint and context.

It involves organized ways of doing things.
 It covers the intended and unintended interactions between products (machines, devices, artifacts) and the people and systems who make them,
 use them or are affected by them through various processes. Many people like to drink coffee, often in a coffee shop. 
That coffee may have come from trees which have been bred specifically for increased yields that support a small farmer and his family but that requires pesticides that were developed
 and manufactured in another country. The harvested coffee beans will themselves be transported around the world, to be processed and placed in packages which are are distributed to shops
 that then make the cup of coffee in a polystyrene cup that was manufactured.
